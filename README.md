## TODO ‚úÖ

- [ ] Better Error handling
  - As an MVP, the assumption is happy path for most of the actions.
- [ ] Better loading indicators
- [ ] Write tests
  - [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for E2E and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) for integration tests.
- [ ] Responsive design
  - [ ] For the moment this is for **desktop** only
- [ ] Shareable links
  - [ ] Use the power of the [router](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/router) to save the current state of the interaction. This could be an improvement to remove the `activeVariable`'s from codebase and make the use of [query parameters](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) to have a URL to share/save and access in the future.
- [ ] **Lists**
  - [ ] Delete an image from a list
  - [ ] Delete a list
- [ ] **Images**
  - [ ] Indicate that an image is already saved in a **list**.
  - [ ] Modal navigation to previous/next image
- [ ] [Prefetching](https://react-query.tanstack.com/docs/guides/prefetching) could improve the UX on the **Search**
